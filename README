Welcome to Q2VKPT, a Quake II engine with real-time path tracing.  This client
implements fully dynamic illumination without precomputation supporting area
light sources, reflections, soft shadows, and indirect illumination. This
client is a port of our real-time path tracer vkpt and is based on the Quake II
engine Q2PRO.

This client requires a high-end GPU supporting the Vulkan extension
VK_NV_ray_tracing.

Please refer to our project page for more details.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1) CD to your base Git directory.

Step 2) We need SPIRV to build shaders

git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools.git   spirv-tools
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers.git spirv-tools/external/spirv-headers
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git          spirv-tools/external/googletest
git clone https://github.com/google/effcee.git              spirv-tools/external/effcee
git clone https://github.com/google/re2.git                 spirv-tools/external/re2

Step 3) Build SPIRV:

cd SPIRV-Tools
mkdir build && cd build
cmake [-G <platform-generator>] SPIRV-Tools

Step 4) You need OpenVR to be installed too:

cd ..

git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr

OR 

git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr q2vkpt/external/openvr

ADDITIONAL FILES REQUIRED

Step 5) You also need Pak0.pak and other files from a real quake 2 (or demo) installation to be copied into baseq2 subfolder.
